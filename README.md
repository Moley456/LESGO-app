## Motivation
Tired of your friends overusing the replies “Anything” or “I don’t know” when asked where to go? Or perhaps you are guilty of being part of the problem? It is not surprising that many of us encounter such dilemmas in our daily lives. We Singaporeans are spoilt for choice and do not take making these decisions seriously. Furthermore, being a student/youth could mean our choices will have to take into account our budgets.  

This may seem like a trivial issue, but it can be one that strains relationships due to ineffective communication. Moreover, not everyone in the group will fully enjoy the activity as they simply follow through with whatever that is suggested. Hence, LESGO! will be an application for anyone looking for an enjoyable adventure but can’t make up their mind or don't know where to go!  

## Aim
Our team intends to ease the decision-making process amongst groups of friends (mainly students/youths) during planning of gatherings through effective recommendations on the application.
